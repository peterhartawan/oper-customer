But her most notable invention was the compiler, which can transform a source language into binary code. (In other words, it can translate the code you and I write into 0s and 1s.) She developed it in 1952, but she said \"Nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.\"</p>\n\t\t\t</timeline-item>\n\t\t\t<timeline-item line-color=\"#a6ade4\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Contributions to space exploration</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"append\">One of the first African-American women to earn a Ph.D in mathematics, Evelyn Boyd Granville focused on aeronautics and space during her career. In 1956, she worked with NASA and IBM on Project Mercury, the first manned space flight. She worked with NASA again a few years later on the Apollo Project.</p>\n\t\t\t</timeline-item>\n\t\t</timeline>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n",null]}
